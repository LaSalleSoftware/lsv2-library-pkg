Library package for my LaSalle Software.  ** DO NOT USE! **

## DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE!

THIS PACKAGE WAS SPLIT INTO TWO SEPARATE PACKAGES: A FRONT-END LIBRARY PACKAGE AND A BACK-END LIBRARY PACKAGE. 

THIS PACKAGE EXISTS AS REFERENCE ONLY TO PRESERVE THE INDIVIDUAL COMMITS AND ISSUES THAT THESE NEW PACKAGES INHERITED. 

## Security

If you discover any security related issues, please email Bob Bloom at "bob dot bloom at lasallesoftware dot ca" instead of using the issue tracker.

## Caveat

You need to buy [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/), first first-party Laravel Framework administration panel package.
