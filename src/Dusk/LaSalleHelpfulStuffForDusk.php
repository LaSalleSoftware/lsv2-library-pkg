     * Return the second-to-last UUID model.
     *
     * After running all 243 Dusk tests and 1,931 assertions successfully, I ran "composer update". Then, the errors
     * started! One reason was the new mysterious double insertion into the uuids database table. My Nova forms properly
     * used the first uuid generated as usual, but an unused second record is consistently inserted into uuids as well in
     * all my Nova create and update forms. I did not dig into this because of the need to press ahead and accepting that
     * for now I am going to have a lot of uuid records in the uuids db table that are not used. My guess is that Nova
     * v2.0.8 is double rendering the creation and update forms so that two uuid's are being generated even though only
     * the first one is actually in the form.
     *
     * Of course, the unused uuid is now expected in my tests. Well, the uuid that is actually used is now the
     * second-to-last uuid in the uuids db table. So, in case there is some problem/situation in the future, I am whipping
     * up this function. So I have a nice clean one-liner in my tests, if I have to mess with this again in the future
     * BTW: that one-liner is: $uuid = $this->getSecondLastUuidId();
     *
     *
     * @return mixed
